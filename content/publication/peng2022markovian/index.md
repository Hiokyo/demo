abstract: "With the advancement in smart grid and smart energy devices, demand response becomes one of the most economic and feasible solutions to ease the load stress of the power grids during peak hours. In this letter, we propose a fully decentralized ensemble control framework with consensus for demand response (DR) events and compatible control methods based on random policies. We show that under the consensus that is tailored to DR, our proposed decentralized control method yields the same optimality as the centralized control method in both myopic and multistage settings."
