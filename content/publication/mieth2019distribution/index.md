abstract: "Distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) facilitate the efficient operation of low-voltage electric power distribution systems. We propose an approach to internalize the stochasticity of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) and risk tolerance of the distribution system operator in DLMP computations. This is achieved by means of applying conic duality to a chance-constrained AC optimal power flow. We show that the resulting DLMPs consist of the terms that allow to itemize the prices for the active and reactive power production, balancing regulation, network power losses, and voltage support provided. Finally, we prove the proposed DLMP constitute a competitive equilibrium, which can be leveraged for designing a distribution electricity market, and show that imposing chance constraints on voltage limits distorts the equilibrium."
