abstract: "This paper presents an overview of recent LVRT solutions for Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) based on hardware and software or a combination of both. The transient behavior of the system under three-phase grid fault is therefore simulated. Among the software solutions, the stator current feedback and demagnetizing current injection strategies are analyzed and simulated, and a coordinated crowbar, rotor side and grid side converter control is provided as the hardware software combination."
